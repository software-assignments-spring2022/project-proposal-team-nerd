# Project Proposal - Agile Software Development and DevOps

# Project Find and Furnish 

## Proposed System 

Find and Furnish is a system that will primarily connect users to multiple sources (i.e. Walmart, Target, Google, Amazon) for furniture and household items at afforable prices and display them all at once. Secondarily, F&F may outline what their possible living spaces by allowing users to visualize their future home using a 2D display.   

### Target Audience 

The target audience are those who are living in temporary housing spaces such as apartmets and dorms who require afforable furniture pieces. Due to the lack of large and/or consistent income whilst in university or starting out post-schooling, many w graduate renters/dormers have a hard time visualizing the amount of space they will be occupying as well as may not know the space constraints when it comes to buying furniture, especially when living in cities such as NYC. Therefore, F&F will make it easier for anyone to find and compare afforable items for their home. With a system such as this, people coming into city/moving into their first apartments would save time and money. 

## Gameplan 

Upon loading Find and Furnish, users will be asked if they would like to design their apartment or seek furnishings for their future home. Whether they pick the first or second option, users may switch or open up a dual display at any time. The design portion will look similar to a simpler version of Tinkercad, a website where you can drag and drop electrical components to create a circuit, where users will be able to drop simple shapes of sizes relative to a given living space to see how their future room will look. The search portion will be less graphics heavy as it will be a database with listing from multiple websites with each listing coming with picture(s), price, size, material, and source. 

While creating login and accounts would be helpful to the system, the time constraint does not ensure that the two main functionalities above will be complete. In the event that either functionalities above will need to pivot, the inclusion of login accounts can be discussed.
